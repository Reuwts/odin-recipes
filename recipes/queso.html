        <h3><p>The bane of every queso-makers existence is curdling.
            The use of cream cheese in my queso guards against this common issue.
            The stabilizers in the cream cheese work to prevent the cheese
            from curdling when heated. This works to our advantage in
            the queso dip because, unlike hard cheeses like cheddar
            which can separate when heated, the cream cheese will
            melt and make the dip homogeneous.</p></h3>
        <p>Leftover queso may be stored in the refrigerator so long as it hasn’t been
           left out for more than two hours. Keep the dip in a food storage container
           for up to 72 hours. Reheat the queso in the microwave or on the stove
           until warmed through.</p>
