This is a beginner project to showcase basic yet fundamental skills related to git and html. This will be a great starting point to look back on in the future to see how far I've come. In this project I aim to showcase the following skills:

- Create a basic html website consisting of absolute and relative links, images and some simple text.
- Use Github to upload and showcase this project building on my git CLI skills.
